# Purpose of *FloBoard*
    
#### *FloBoard* is made for the purpose of assisting people with fine motor control disorders and those experiencing symptoms often associated with movement disorders and head injuries that include hand tremors and dexterity issues. 
The intention was to enable those with various disorders and diseases such as but not limited to multiple sclerosis, hyperthyroidism, Parkinson's disease, and rheumatoid arthritis with the ability to text and type with more ease. The app is designed for Android and uses the accelerometer to determine the orientation of the device. This allows for the circular keyboard to move clockwise and counterclockwise depending on the angle at which the phone is tilted until the desired value is found.
